I AM VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATING IN THE AFOREMENTIONED ACTIVITY
AND I AM PARTICIPATING IN THE ACTIVITY ENTIRELY AT MY OWN RISK. I AM
AWARE OF THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH TRAVELING TO AND FROM AS WELL
AS PARTICIPATING IN THIS ACTIVITY, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

RELATED RISKS, BOTH KNOWN OR UNKNOWN TO ME, OF MY PARTICIPATION
IN THIS ACTIVITY, INCLUDING TRAVEL TO, FROM AND DURING THIS
ACTIVITY.
I agree to indemnify and hold harmless Bike Kollective against any and all claims,
suits or actions of any kind whatsoever for liability, damages, compensation or otherwise brought

pursuant to any claims made by me or by anyone else acting on my behalf. If
Bike Kollective incurs any of these types of expenses, I agree to reimburse
Bike Kollective.
I acknowledge that Bike Kollective and their directors, officers, volunteers,
representatives and agents are not responsible for errors, omissions, acts or failures to act of any

I ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE CAREFULLY READ THIS WAIVER AND

In the event that I should require medical care or treatment, I agree to be financially responsible
for any costs incurred as a result of such treatment. I am aware and understand that I should carry
my own health insurance.
In the event that any damage to equipment or facilities occurs as a result of my or my familys
willful actions, neglect or recklessness, I acknowledge and agree to be held liable for any and all
costs associated with any actions of neglect or recklessness. (adapted from formswift.com)`
